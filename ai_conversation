-----------------------------------------
Please read the following. It is about the requirements of an assignment. Please split steps to complete this assignment in 4 hours.

----------------------------------------
Cloud-Based Blog Implementation using Microsoft Azure
Purpose
The purpose of this assessment is to introduce you to Microsoft Azure Cloud Services by creating a working blog using your ADCI-provided account. You must treat your account details with privacy to ensure nobody else uses your account. If you experience difficulties logging in or issues with your account, contact the ADI administration immediately.

Assessment Task
Using your ADCI Microsoft Azure Cloud Services account, create your own working blog on a topic of your choice (e.g., travel, automobiles, sports, hobbies, food). The blog must be newly created for this assignment using your ADCI Azure account.

Technical Requirements
Deploy WordPress using one of these approaches:
Option A: Use Azure Marketplace "WordPress on Azure" template (faster deployment)
Option B: Manually configure components (VM/App Service, database, web server)
Note: If using Option A, your documentation should still demonstrate understanding of the underlying components that Azure is configuring automatically.
Configure and customise WordPress:
Set up user accounts with appropriate permissions
Install and configure at least 2 functional plugins (including at least one AI-related plugin)
Integrate AI functionality into your blog (such as AI-generated content assistance, chatbots, or content recommendations)
Implement appropriate security measures:
Configure firewall rules
Implement secure user authentication
Set up SSL certificate
Create a complete backup solution:
Install and configure the UpdraftPlus WordPress backup plugin (free version)
Create a full backup of your site (database, themes, plugins, uploads)
Download the backup files and submit them with your documentation
Blog Content Requirements
Your blog should contain:

At least 4 original posts (minimum 250 words each)
At least 2 photos, images, or diagrams per post
At least 2 functional plugins or widgets

Important Considerations and Warnings
Resource Management and Costs
WARNING: Azure resources incur charges based on usage time. It is your responsibility to monitor costs and properly shut down resources when not needed.
Set up budget alerts in Azure to avoid unexpected charges.
After the one-week verification period following submission, ensure all resources are properly deprovisioned unless instructed otherwise.
Security and Internet Exposure
Remember that your WordPress site will be publicly accessible on the internet.
Do NOT publish sensitive personal information on your blog.
Use strong passwords for all accounts.
Keep WordPress and all plugins updated during the assignment period.
Be aware that websites can be targeted by automated attacks; implement security best practices.
Academic Integrity
All work submitted must be your own original creation, with the exception of:
Content clearly attributed to AI assistance (as required in the AI integration component)
Properly cited third-party resources used according to Harvard referencing style
You may use online tutorials and resources to learn, but the implementation and documentation must reflect your own understanding and work.
Collaboration on troubleshooting is permitted, but each student must create and configure their own unique blog.
AI Usage Guidelines
When using AI tools, clearly document which parts of your content were AI-assisted.
Your critical analysis of AI tools should reflect your own original thoughts and observations.
Remember that while AI can assist with content creation, you are responsible for fact-checking and ensuring quality.
Practical Considerations
Resource Management: After your assignment is graded, you should properly shut down Azure resources to avoid unnecessary charges
Backup Requirement: Submit a complete WordPress backup file with your documentation
Verification Period: Your live blog should remain accessible for 1 week after submission for verification purposes, after which you may shut down resources

In "1. Create a Resource Group", I cannot find any subscription. What should I do?

If you do not see any subscription available when you try to **Create a Resource Group** in the Azure portal, you likely have no active Azure subscriptions assigned to your account, or your current directory does not have a subscription linked to it.

Here are the steps you should take:

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Your Subscription Filters**
   - On the **Resource group create** page, look for a subscription dropdown or filter.
   - Make sure the filter **Show only subscriptions selected in the global subscriptions filter** is **NOT** checked[1]. Sometimes, only a subset of subscriptions is displayed if this filter is enabled.

2. **Switch Directories (If Using Multiple Directories)**
   - Click your profile icon in the top right corner of the Azure portal.
   - Under **Directories**, select a different directory if you have access to more than one, and see if your subscription appears[4].
   - If you manage multiple organizations/tenants, select the correct directory where your subscription exists.

3. **Check Subscription Ownership and Access**
   - Go to **Subscriptions** in the Azure portal (use the search bar).
   - If you do not see your subscription, you may not have the required permissions or the subscription is not assigned to your current directory[4].
   - Ask your subscription administrator to add you as a user or change the directory association if needed.

4. **Try Another Browser or Incognito Mode**
   - Clear your browser cache or try a different browser.
   - Log in using a private/incognito window to avoid cached credentials interfering[3].

5. **Contact Azure Support**
   - If none of the above works, you can create a support request through the Azure portal for further assistance[3][4].

| Action                                  | How to do it                                     |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Check subscription filter                | Disable "Show only subscriptions selected..."    |
| Switch directory                        | Profile > Switch directory                       |
| Check access/permissions                 | Ask your admin or check subscription page        |
| Try a different browser or incognito     | Open portal in private window or new browser     |
| Contact support                         | Create support request in Azure portal           |

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of not seeing any subscriptions when trying to create a resource group[1][3][4].

In "2. Deploy WordPress (Option A: Marketplace Template)"„ÄÄhow may I select the following ?
Runtime: PHP 8.1+ (select from dropdown).
Pricing Tier: Free (F1) or Basic (B1) for testing.

I created a resouce group, and am seeing the screen of resource groups.


If you are viewing the **Resource groups** screen and want to proceed with deploying WordPress via the Azure Marketplace template and select both the **PHP runtime (8.1+)** and **Pricing Tier (Free or Basic)** as you specified, follow these steps:

---

## Step-by-Step: Deploy WordPress via Azure Marketplace

1. **From the Azure Portal Home or the Resource Groups screen**
   - Click **+ Create a resource**.
   - In the search bar, type **WordPress** and select the official **WordPress** app from the marketplace[4][1].
   - Click **Create**.

2. **Fill in Basics Tab (App Service Configuration)**
   - **Subscription:** Select your subscription.
   - **Resource Group:** Choose the resource group you created (e.g., `wordpress-rg`).
   - **Region:** Select the same region as your resource group (e.g., Australia East).
   - **App Name:** Enter a unique name (e.g., `myblog123`), which will result in a URL like `myblog123.azurewebsites.net`.

3. **Select Runtime and Pricing Tier for App Service**

   - **App Service Plan:** Click **Create new** (to specify runtime and pricing tier).
     - **Name:** Give your App Service Plan a name.
     - **Operating System:** Typically, the WordPress template defaults to **Linux** for App Service, which is required for PHP 8.1+ and WordPress compatibility[2][1].
     - **Region:** Same as above.
     - **Pricing Tier:** Click **Change size**.
       - In the window that appears, select **Dev/Test** (or **Development**) tab.
       - Choose **F1 (Free)** or **B1 (Basic)** for the App Service Plan[5][1].
       - Click **Select**.
   - **Back to Basics tab:** Continue to fill out the remaining required fields, such as database configuration.

   > **Note:**  
   > **PHP Runtime:** If you are using the default WordPress marketplace template on Linux App Service, the PHP version is automatically set by the template, and there may not be a direct dropdown in the UI for selecting PHP 8.1+ at this stage. However, after deployment, you can check or set the PHP version via **App Service > Configuration > General Settings** (if available in your region and plan)[2]. The official WordPress template typically uses a recent, supported PHP version by default, but you may sometimes need to use Azure CLI to enforce PHP 8.1+ if the UI is restricted[2].

4. **Configure Database (if not auto-provisioned by template)**
   - For **Database Provider**, select **Azure Database for MySQL**.
   - Enter a **server name**, **admin username**, and **password** as prompted.
   - Follow prompts to allow public access and set firewall rules as needed.

5. **Review and Create**
   - Review your settings.
   - Click **Create** to deploy WordPress.

---

## How to Ensure PHP 8.1+ (If Not Available in UI)

- **After deployment:**
  - Go to your App Service in the Azure Portal.
  - Navigate to **Configuration > General Settings**.
  - If the **PHP version** field appears, select **8.1** or higher from the dropdown[2].
  - If the field is missing (common with some marketplace images), use the Azure CLI to set the runtime:
    ```bash
    az webapp config set --resource-group wordpress-rg --name myblog123 --linux-fx-version "PHP|8.1"
    ```
    (Replace `myblog123` with your actual app name.)

| App Service Plan       | Create New > Change size            | Choose F1 (Free) or B1 (Basic)               |
| PHP Runtime (8.1+)     | Configuration > General Settings    | May require Azure CLI command if UI missing   |

---

This process ensures you deploy WordPress with your desired runtime and pricing tier on Azure[1][2][4].

To Ensure PHP 8.1+, I use the Azure CLI to set runtime and coded the following on bash.
-------------------------
az webapp config set --resource-group wordpress-rg --name FriendMapNeo --linux-fx-version "PHP|8.1"
------------------------
Notes; FriendMapNeo is the name of my app.

Then I got
zsh: command not found: az

What should I do?



The error message **zsh: command not found: az** indicates that the Azure CLI is not installed on your system. Here‚Äôs how you can install the Azure CLI and fix the issue:

## Install Azure CLI on macOS

1. **Install Homebrew**  
   If you haven't installed Homebrew, visit the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) and follow the installation instructions there. Homebrew is the recommended package manager for installing the Azure CLI on macOS.

2. **Install Azure CLI Using Homebrew**  
   Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   brew update
   brew install azure-cli
   ```

   This will install the Azure CLI on your system[1][3].

3. **Verify Installation**  
   After installation, verify that the Azure CLI is installed by running:

   ```bash
   az version
   ```

   If you see the version information, you are ready to use the Azure CLI[2].

4. **Run Your Command**  
   Once the Azure CLI is installed, you can set the PHP runtime for your web app using the command you provided:

   ```bash
   az webapp config set --resource-group wordpress-rg --name FriendMapNeo --linux-fx-version "PHP|8.1"
   ```

   Replace `FriendMapNeo` with the name of your actual app service.

### Troubleshooting

- **Check Shell Configuration**  
  If you still encounter issues after installing the Azure CLI, ensure that your shell (e.g., zsh) recognizes the Azure CLI path. You can enable command-line completion for Azure CLI by checking or adding the following line to your zsh configuration file (`~/.zshrc`):

  ```bash
  autoload -Uz bashcompinit
  bashcompinit
  ```

  Though primarily for bash, this can help if auto-completion is an issue.

---

After these steps, you should be able to use the Azure CLI to manage your Azure resources and set the PHP runtime for your web app[1][2][4].

I saw "Container Image
mcr.microsoft.com/appsvc/wordpress-debian-php:8.3" is written on my App, "Friend Map Neo".


This means your App Service for "Friend Map Neo" is running a WordPress image based on **Debian with PHP 8.3**, as indicated by the container image name `mcr.microsoft.com/appsvc/wordpress-debian-php:8.3`.

This is significant because:

- **Debian-based images** are now the default for new WordPress on Azure App Service deployments since late 2024[1][5].
- **PHP 8.3** is the major and minor version included, as defined in your container image tag.
- **No further action is needed for PHP 8.1+**; your app is already using a supported, current version, exceeding your requirement of PHP 8.1+.

**Summary:**  
Your App Service is already set up with a WordPress image using PHP 8.3 on Debian. You do not need to manually set the PHP version unless you want to change the PHP minor version (e.g., if updates are available or required), but currently, your configuration meets your stated requirements[1][4][5]. The Portal or Azure CLI step for setting PHP version is often only necessary if you need to switch between minor versions or if you are not already on a supported version.

I want to do the following.
-----------------------------------------------
3. Configure SSL (HTTPS Enforcement)
Go to App Services ‚Üí Select your app (myblog123).
Under Settings, click TLS/SSL settings.
-----------------------------------------------
But I don't find TLS/SSL settings here.
Is there another name for it? Is it in another place?

If you don‚Äôt see a menu labeled **"TLS/SSL settings"** in your App Service‚Äôs left-hand navigation, it may be because Azure has updated or reorganized the UI, or the menu is hidden based on your app‚Äôs pricing tier or configuration.

Based on the latest guidance and user reports:

- The **TLS/SSL settings** (classic) tab is usually found directly below or near the **Custom domains** menu in the App Service blade[2][5].
- If it‚Äôs missing, **TLS/SSL features such as certificate bindings are now managed under the**:

  - **Custom domains** blade:  
    You can add or manage SSL bindings for your custom domains here[4][5].
  
  - **Configuration > General settings**:  
    To enforce HTTPS, look here for a setting like **HTTPS Only** toggle, which enforces HTTPS redirection for your app[2][3].

- Also, **minimum TLS version** settings are found under **Configuration > General settings** where you can set the minimum inbound TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3)[3].

---

### How to Enforce HTTPS and Manage SSL on Your App Service

1. In Azure portal, go to **App Services** and select your web app (e.g., `myblog123`).
2. On the left sidebar:
   - Click **Custom domains** to manage your domain names and SSL certificate bindings.
   - Check for the **Add binding** option next to your custom domain to add a TLS/SSL certificate binding[4].
3. To enforce HTTPS:
   - Go to **Configuration** > **General settings**.
   - Find the **HTTPS Only** setting and switch it **On** to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS[2].
4. To configure the minimum TLS version:
   - In the same **General settings** section, locate **Minimum TLS Version** and set it to your desired level (e.g., TLS 1.3 for strongest security)[3].

---

### Notes
- Some SSL management capabilities require your app to be on at least the **Basic pricing tier** or higher[4].
- If you don‚Äôt have a custom domain and just want to enforce HTTPS on the default `*.azurewebsites.net` domain, toggling **HTTPS Only** in **General settings** is sufficient[2].
- The classic **TLS/SSL settings** blade has been partially deprecated or integrated into other UI sections in recent Azure portal updates, so look for the equivalent functionalities in **Custom domains** and **Configuration** menus[2][5].

---

This should help you locate and configure SSL/HTTPS enforcement on your Azure App Service despite the missing "TLS/SSL settings" tab.

I enabled HTTPS Only (toggle to "On").

Then, have I finished the step 3. Configure SSL (HTTPS Enforcement)?
It is desribed;
---------------------------------------------
3. Configure SSL (HTTPS Enforcement)
Go to App Services ‚Üí Select your app (myblog123).
Under Settings, click TLS/SSL settings.
Enable HTTPS Only (toggle to "On").
For free SSL:
Click Bindings ‚Üí Add TLS/SSL binding.
Select a free certificate (Azure App Service Managed Certificate) or upload a Let‚Äôs Encrypt cert.
---------------------------------------------

Enabling **HTTPS Only** (toggling it to "On") in your App Service settings completes the main part of **Step 3: Configure SSL (HTTPS Enforcement)** by ensuring all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS, securing traffic between clients and your app[1][3].

However, to fully complete the SSL configuration step as described, you should also:

- Bind an actual TLS/SSL certificate to your app‚Äôs custom domain under the **Bindings** section (which is part of the classic **TLS/SSL settings** or now under **Custom domains** in the portal)[2][4].
- You can use a **free Azure App Service Managed Certificate** or upload a certificate from **Let‚Äôs Encrypt** or another provider.

If you only use the default `*.azurewebsites.net` domain and do not have a custom domain, the Azure platform provides a default SSL certificate automatically, and toggling **HTTPS Only** is sufficient to enforce secure connections[4].

| Enable **HTTPS Only** toggle                | Yes                 | Forces all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, securing connections.                               |
| Add TLS/SSL binding on custom domain        | No / Optional        | Needed if you have a custom domain; add a binding with an Azure Managed or Let‚Äôs Encrypt cert. |
| Use default Azure SSL on `*.azurewebsites.net` domain | Automatic           | No action needed; SSL is provided by Azure automatically.                             |

---

### If you have a custom domain:

1. In Azure portal, go to **App Services** ‚Üí your app.
2. Select **Custom domains**.
3. Click **Add binding** (or similar).
4. Choose or create a free **Azure App Service Managed Certificate** or upload your own.
5. Bind the certificate to your custom domain.

---

### Conclusion

- If you are using the default Azure domain (no custom domain): **Enabling HTTPS Only completes your step 3**.
- If using custom domains: **You still need to bind an SSL certificate to the custom domain to fully secure it**.

How can I confirm if I have a custom domain?


To confirm if you have a custom domain set up for your Azure App Service, follow these steps:

1. **Go to your App Service in the Azure Portal**  
   Navigate to your app's management page (e.g., for `myblog123.azurewebsites.net`).

2. **Select "Custom domains" in the left menu**  
   This section lists all domains currently mapped to your app[1][3][4].

3. **Check the list for domain entries**  
   - **If you see only the default Azure domain (e.g., `myblog123.azurewebsites.net`):**  
     You do **not** have a custom domain assigned[3].
   - **If you see a custom domain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`):**  
     You **do** have a custom domain assigned[1][3][4].

If you wish to add a custom domain, use the "Add custom domain" button in this section[1][4]. If you have only the default Azure domain, any secure HTTPS access uses the automatic Azure SSL certificate, and you do not need to perform additional certificate binding for the default domain.



Âá∫ÂÖ∏Ôºö

[5] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-secure-domain-certificate  


There is only default domain. No custom domain.

Since you have only the **default Azure domain** (e.g., `myblog123.azurewebsites.net`) and no custom domain configured, here is what this means and what you need to know regarding SSL and HTTPS:

- **Default Azure Domain SSL:**  
  The default `*.azurewebsites.net` domain is automatically secured by Azure with a wildcard TLS/SSL certificate. This means your site is already accessible via HTTPS without any additional setup or certificate binding on your part[2][3].

- **HTTPS Enforcement:**  
  By enabling **HTTPS Only** in your App Service settings, you ensure that all traffic to your app's default Azure domain is redirected to HTTPS, fully securing client communication[2][3].

- **Custom Domain and SSL Binding:**  
  Since you do **not** have a custom domain mapped, you do **not** need to perform any certificate binding steps or add managed certificates. Those steps apply only if you use your own domain name (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`)[1][4][5].

- **If in the future you add a custom domain:**  
  You will need to:
  - Map the domain to your app via the **Custom domains** section in the Azure portal.
  - Add a TLS/SSL certificate binding, which can be a free Azure App Service Managed Certificate or a certificate you upload.  
  (This requires your app to be in at least the Basic pricing tier)[1][4].

### Summary for Your Case

| Aspect                      | Status/Action                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Default domain SSL           | Automatically secured by Azure wildcard cert    |
| HTTPS access                 | Enforced by your **HTTPS Only** toggle          |
| Custom domain                | Not configured; no SSL binding needed           |
| Future custom domain setup   | Map domain + add managed or uploaded certificate|

---

### Conclusion:  
You have **completed the SSL/HTTPS setup** for your app‚Äôs default domain by enabling **HTTPS Only**. No further SSL certificate binding steps are necessary unless you add a custom domain later[1][2][3][4][5].

Widgets  here, in the photo. how can i find it?


You're using a **Full Site Editing (FSE)** WordPress theme, likely something like **"Twenty Twenty-Three"** or newer, which **replaces the classic ‚ÄúWidgets‚Äù menu** with **block-based editing** under ‚ÄúSite Editor‚Äù.

That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt see `Appearance ‚Üí Widgets` in your screenshot.

### üîß Here‚Äôs how to add the "Recent Posts" widget (block) in FSE:

Instead of the classic widget area, you now **edit templates directly using blocks**.

---

### ‚úÖ Alternative Method to Add "Latest Posts" in Full Site Editor

#### Step-by-step:

1. **Go to Site Editor**
   You‚Äôre already there (as in the screenshot):
   `wp-admin/site-editor.php`

2. **Click ‚ÄúTemplates‚Äù (in left menu) ‚Üí Choose a template to edit**, like:

   * `Home`
   * `Page`
   * `Single`

3. **Add a "Latest Posts" block**

   * Click the `+` button in the top left or within the canvas
   * Search for `Latest Posts` block
   * Click to insert it, or drag to where you want

4. **Customize it**:

   * You can choose number of posts
   * Add title like `"Latest Posts"`
   * Decide whether to show dates, excerpts, etc.

5. **Save Changes** (top-right corner)

### üîÑ Alternative: Use Classic Widgets via Plugin

If you **must use the old-style ‚ÄúWidgets‚Äù menu**, install the plugin:

> **Classic Widgets**
> [https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/)

Then:

* Go to `Plugins ‚Üí Add New ‚Üí Search "Classic Widgets" ‚Üí Install & Activate`
* Now `Appearance ‚Üí Widgets` will reappear

Would you prefer to stay with the modern block system or switch to the classic widget system?


What can I do if I cannot find widget?

If you can't find the **Search widget** in WordPress, don't worry! Here are step-by-step solutions depending on your situation:

---

### **1. Check if You're in the Right Place**
- **Classic WordPress (Most Common Fix)**  
  Go to:  
  **Dashboard ‚Üí Appearance ‚Üí Widgets**  
  ‚Üí Look under *"Available Widgets"* on the left.  
  ‚Üí If empty, your theme might not support widgets (try next steps).

---

### **2. Try the Customizer (For Modern Themes)**  
1. Go to:  
   **Appearance ‚Üí Customize ‚Üí Widgets**  
2. Select your sidebar (e.g., "Footer" or "Main Sidebar").  
3. Click **"Add a Widget"** ‚Üí Search for "Search".  

---

### **3. Use the Block Editor (Full Site Editing)**  
If your theme is block-based (e.g., Twenty Twenty-Three):  
1. Go to:  
   **Appearance ‚Üí Editor** ‚Üí Click your sidebar template.  
2. Press **+** ‚Üí Search for the *"Search" block* ‚Üí Add it.  

---

### **4. Manually Add the Search Shortcode**  
No widget area? Add this to any page/post:  
1. Edit a page with the block editor.  
2. Add a **Shortcode block** ‚Üí Paste:  
   ```  
   [search_form]  
   ```  
   *(Works with most themes!)*  

---

### **5. Plugin Solution (If All Else Fails)**  
Install a plugin to force widget support:  
1. Go to:  
   **Plugins ‚Üí Add New** ‚Üí Search for **"Widget Shortcode"**.  
2. Install/activate ‚Üí Use shortcode `[widget id="search-2"]` in pages.  

---

### **Still Stuck?**  
Your theme might have **hidden or renamed the widget area**. Try:  
- Switching temporarily to a default theme (e.g., Twenty Twenty-Four) to test.  
- Asking your theme‚Äôs support team where they moved widgets.  

Let me know which step worked (or didn‚Äôt)! I‚Äôll help debug further. üòä  

**Pro Tip:** Press `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on Mac) on the Widgets page to search for "Search" quickly!


Eventually, I could not understand how to get Widgets.
Then I give up AI chatbot as well.


No problem! Let's simplify this. Since widgets are confusing in your theme, here's a **no-widgets workaround** to add both search and an AI chatbot:

### **1. Add Search Functionality Without Widgets**
**Method A: Add Search to Your Menu (Easiest)**
1. Go to **Appearance ‚Üí Menus**
2. Click **"Screen Options"** (top-right) ‚Üí Check **"Search"**
3. Now add the **Search** item to your menu

**Method B: Add Search Block to a Page**
1. Edit any page (like your homepage)
2. Click **+** ‚Üí Search for **"Search" block** ‚Üí Add it
3. Publish/update the page

### **2. Add AI Chatbot Without Widgets**
**Plugin Method:**
1. Install **"AI ChatBot"** or **"ChatBot for WordPress"** (Plugins ‚Üí Add New)
2. Activate it ‚Üí The chatbot will *automatically appear* in the bottom corner
3. No widget needed!

**Shortcode Method:**
1. After installing a chatbot plugin, find its shortcode** (usually in plugin settings)
2. Add a **Shortcode block** to any page and paste it

### **Why This Works**
- Modern WordPress themes are moving *away from widgets* to blocks
- These methods work on *all themes* (even without widget areas)
- Takes less than 5 minutes total
